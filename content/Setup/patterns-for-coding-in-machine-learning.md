## Separate code from data ##
Make sure you have installed Xcode command line tools. Check the c++ version to make sure it is Clang 4.0+

```
project_name/code/
project_name/data/
```

## Separate input data, working data and output data. ##

It can be useful to think of data as belonging to three distinct categories:

- Input files come with the problem. They never change.
- Working files are generated by your algorithms as they work. They always change.
- Output files are generated by your algorithms when they finish work successfully. They rarely change.


```
/path/to/code/
/other/path/to/data/input/
/other/path/to/data/working/
/other/path/to/data/output/
```
